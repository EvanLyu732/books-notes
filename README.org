** Notes:
- Traction is the best way to improve your chances of startup success. Traction is a signthat something is working. If you charge for your product, it means customers are
buying. If your product is free, it’s a growing user base. Traction is powerful. Technical, market, and team risks are easier to address with
traction. Fund-raising, hiring, press, partnerships, and acquisitions all become much
easier. 
In other words, traction trumps everything.

-  Founders have an idea for a company they’re excited about. Initial excitement turns
into a struggle to build a product, but they do get something out the door. 

-  Traction is a sign that your company is
taking off. It’s obvious in your core metrics: If you have a mobile app, your download
rate is growing rapidly. If you’re running a subscription service, your monthly revenue is
skyrocketing. If you’re an organic bakery, your number of transactions is increasing
every week. You get the point. 

- Traction is basically quantitative evidence of customer demand. So if you’re in enterprise
software, [initial traction] may be two or three early customers who are paying a bit; if
you’re in consumer software the bar might be as high as hundreds of thousands of users.   --- Naval

- A startup is a company designed to grow fast. Being newly founded does not in itself make
a company a startup. Nor is it necessary for a startup to work on technology, or take
venture funding, or have some sort of “exit.” The only essential thing is growth. Everything
else we associate with startups follows from growth. 

Traction is growth. The pursuit of traction is what defines a startup.

- The number one reason that we pass on entrepreneurs we’d otherwise like to back is
they’re focusing on product to the exclusion of everything else. Many entrepreneurs who
build great products simply don’t have a good distribution strategy. Even worse is when
they insist that they don’t need one, or call [their] no distribution strategy a “viral
marketing strategy.”

- Having a product or service that your early customers love, but having no clear way to
get more traction is a major problem. To solve this problem, spend your time
constructing your product or service and testing traction channels in parallel.

- Traction and product development are of equal importance and should each get about
half of your attention. This is what we call the 50 percent rule: spend 50 percent of
your time on product and 50 percent on traction.

- First, you could build something people want, but for which you just can’t figure out a
viable business model. The money isn’t adding up. For example, people won’t pay, and
selling advertising won’t cover the bills. There is just no real market. 

  Second, you could build something people want, but there are just not enough
customers to reach profitability. It’s just too small a market, and there aren’t obvious
ways to expand. This occurs often when startups aren’t ambitious enough and pick too
narrow a niche.

- Third, you could build something people want, but reaching them is cost prohibitive.
You find yourself in a hard-to-reach market. An example is a relatively inexpensive
product that requires a direct sales force to sell it. That combo just doesn’t work. 

- Finally, you could build something people want, but a lot of other companies build it
too. In this situation you are in a hypercompetitive market where it is simply too hard to
get customers.

- If you follow the 50 percent rule from the beginning, then you will have the best
chance of avoiding these traps. If you don’t, then you risk realizing you’re in one of
these traps too late to do anything useful. Unfortunately this happens to a lot of
companies postlaunch. The sad thing is that often these products and services are
useful, =but the companies die because they don’t have a good distribution strategy.=

- First, it helps you build the right product because you can incorporate knowledge from
your traction efforts. If you’re following a good product development process, you’re
already getting good feedback from early customers. However, these customers are
generally too close to you. They often tell you what you want to hear.

- Through traction development you get a steady stream of cold customers. It is through
these people that you can really find out whether the market is taking to your product
or not, and if not, what features are missing or which parts of the experience are
broken.

- You can think of your initial investment in traction as pouring water into a leaky bucket.
At first your bucket will be very leaky because your product is not yet a full solution to
customer needs and problems. In other words, your product is not as sticky as it could
be, and many customers will not want to engage with it yet. As a consequence, much of
the money you are spending on traction will leak out of your bucket.

- This is exactly what happened with Dropbox. While developing their product, they
tested search engine marketing and found it wouldn’t work for their business. They
were acquiring customers for $230 when their product cost only $99. That’s when they
focused on the viral marketing traction channel, and built a referral program right into
their product. This program has since been their biggest growth driver.

- From the perspective of getting traction, you can think about working on a product or
service in three phases: 
    Phase I—making something people want 

    Phase II—marketing something people want 

    Phase III—scaling your business

- As Paul Graham said in his essay “Do Things That Don’t Scale”: 
A lot of would-be founders believe that startups either take off or don’t. You build
something, make it available, and if you’ve made a better mousetrap, people beat a path
to your door as promised. Or they don’t, in which case the market must not exist. 
Actually startups take off because the founders make them take off. . . .

The most common unscalable thing founders have to do at the start is to recruit users manually. Nearly all
startups have to. You can’t wait for users to come to you. You have to go out and get them.

- =We strongly believe that many startups give up way too early.= A lot of startup success
hinges on choosing a great market at the right time. Consider DuckDuckGo, the search
engine startup that Gabriel founded. Other search startups gave up after two years:
Gabriel has been at it for more than seven. 

- =Put half your efforts into getting traction.= Pursue traction and product
development in parallel, and spend equal time on both. Think of your product as
a leaky bucket. Your early traction efforts are pointing you toward the holes
worth plugging.

- =Set your growth goals.= Focus on strategies and tactics that can plausibly move
the needle for your company. Get some hard numbers.

- =Learn what growth numbers potential investors respect.= How much traction is
needed for investors is a moving target, but a sustainable customer growth rate
is hard for investors to ignore. Potential investors who understand your business
are likely to appreciate your traction and thus invest earlier. Traction trumps
everything.

- =Find your bright spots.= If you’re not seeing the traction you want, look for bright
spots in your customer base, pockets of customers who are truly engaged with
your product. See if you can figure out why it works for them and if you can
expand from that base. If there are no bright spots, it may be a good time to
pivot.

- __[You] probably won’t have a bunch of equally good distribution strategies. Engineers
frequently fall victim to this because they do not understand distribution. Since they don’t
know what works, and haven’t thought about it, they try some sales, BD, advertising, and
viral marketing—everything but the kitchen sink. 
That is a really bad idea. It is very likely that one channel is optimal. Most businesses
actually get zero distribution channels to work. =Poor distribution—not product—is the
number one cause of failure.= If you can get even a single distribution channel to work, you
have great business. If you try for several but don’t nail one, you’re finished. So it’s worth
thinking really hard about finding the single best distribution channel.__

- Bullseye: 
   1. what's possible: If you were to advertise offline, where would be the best place to do it? If you were to give a speech,
who would be the ideal audience? Imagine what success would look like in each channel, and write it down in your outer ring.
   2. what’s probable: 
      * How much will it cost to acquire customers through this channel? 
      * How many customers are available through this channel? 
      * Are the customers that you are getting through this channel the kind of customers that you want right now? 
   3. what’s working:  In that case, you should start directing all your traction efforts and resources toward this most promising channel. You hit the Bullseye! You’ve found your
core channel. The goal of this focusing step is quite simple: to wring every bit of traction out of your core channel.

- The biggest mistake startups make when trying to get traction is failing to pursue
traction in parallel with product development. Many entrepreneurs think that if you
build a killer product, your customers will beat a path to your door. =This line of thinking
is a fallacy: that the best use of your time is always improving your product.= =In other
words, “if you build it, they will come” is wrong.=

** Notes:

- Our fundamental idea shall be that man as we know him is not a completed being; that nature develops him only up to a certain point and then leaves him, to develop further, by his own efforts and devices, or to live and die such as he was born, or to degenerate and lose capacity for development.
- Evolution of man in this case will mean the development of certain inner qualities and features which usually remain undeveloped, and cannot develop by themselves.


** Book: What the CEO Wants You to Know : How Your Company Really Works
** Link: https://www.amazon.com/What-CEO-Wants-You-Know/dp/0609608398
** Notes:

- The best CEOs have a knack for bringing the most complex business down to the fundamen- tals the same fundamentals of the family shoe shop.
  They have business acumen the ability to focus on the basics and make money for the company.
- The one thing I’ve noticed is that the best CEOs—the ones whose companies make money year after year—are like the best teacher you ever had. They are able to take the complexity and mystery out of business by focusing on the core fundamentals.
- And as the company has profitable growth—that is, both sales (the “top line”) and profits (the “bottom line”) increase year after year—there are greater opportunities for people to expand their careers and to make more money.
- They have what I call business acumen the ability to understand the building blocks of how a one-person operation or a very big business makes money.
- Once you understood that the atom was made up of protons, electrons, and neutrons, you then had the fundamentals to solve any problem in chemistry. I want to show you that it's the same with business: When you know the fundamentals, you can "get" the basics for how any business works.
- The most successful business leaders never lose sight of the basics. Their intense focus on the fundamentals of business is, in fact, the secret to their success. Like the street vendor, they have a keen sense of how a business makes money. This ability to apply the universal laws of business is what I call business acumen.
- Such career tracks tend to narrow your perspective and influence the decisions and trade-offs you make every day. What's best for your department or function is not necessarily best for the company as a whole. You may be a top-notch professional good marketing but are you at or engineering or financial analysis a businessperson? Regardless of your job, really depart- ment, or chimney, you need to develop your business acumen.
- When you learn to speak the universal language of business, you can have meaningful discussions with anyone in the company, at any level. You'll tear down the walls that separate you, a functional chimney per- son, from those well-dressed senior executives and MBAs who speak a language you may not understand. You'll feel more connected to your company and your work. And the range of opportunities open to you will expand.
- If, on the other hand, he gives people a good deal every time, he builds their trust and loyalty to his brand. He has to be consumer focused.
- Money making in business has three basic parts: cash generation, return on assets a combination of margin and velocity, and growth.
- Cut through to the nucleus of the business. If your business shows deterioration in one or more of the basic components of money making, use common sense to fix it. If you do, you are on your way to thinking and acting like a true businessperson and a successful CEO!
- Cash generation is the difference between all the cash that flows into the business and all the cash that flows out of the business in a given time period. Cash flows into the corporation from sources like the sales of its product or services that are paid for in cash and payments by customers for previous sales made on credit. Cash flows out of the business for items like salaries, taxes, and payments to suppliers.
- But most companies extend credit, so cash and income are different. They make a sale now but collect the money later. They buy something now and pay for it later. They have accounts receivable (money customers owe them) and accounts payable (money they owe their suppliers). The timing of these payments affects cash generation.
- Cash gives you the ability to stay in business. It is a company's oxygen supply. Lack of cash, decreasing cash, or consumption of cash spells trouble, even if the other elements of money making gin and asset velocity  such as profit look good.
- Regardless of the size or kind of business, you're using your own or someone else's money to grow. You borrow from a bank or use your savings. That money represents your investment, or your investment capital. If you inherit the business, the "investment" is given to you.
- The things you've invested in are assets. The assets of an automobile manufacturer include the factories and assembly plants, office buildings, computer systems, and inventories of sheet metal, paint, and components.
- These are tangible assets you can see and touch. The big items, like buildings and machinery, that are not expected to be sold are sometimes called fixed assets.
- Find out the tangible assets in your company. A person with great business acumen will wonder how much money you are able to make with those assets. What kind of money is being returned to you through their use? In short, what is your return on assets, your ROA? Are you making enough of a return on those assets?
- The word velocity describes this idea of speed, turnover, or movement. Think of raw materials moving through a factory and becoming finished products, and think of those finished products moving off the shelf to the customer. That's velocity.
- Some people use the term inventory turns to describe inventory velocity. How many times does the inventory turn over in a year? Wal-Mart has 360 inven- tory turns in toilet tissue. That means the entire inven- tory of toilet tissue is sold almost every day. Each day, Wal-Mart gets back the money it spent on its inventory of toilet tissue, plus some profit. That's a terrific use of shelf space.
- But forget the math. Get the idea of velocity. Things must move through a business to the customer the faster, the better.
- The faster the velocity, the higher the return. In fact, return on assets is nothing more than profit margin multiplied by asset velocity. This is a universal law of business that can be written simply:
        Return = Margin x Velocity
  or
        R = M x V
- Gross margin, from which net profit margin is derived, is also critical to understanding the fundamental anatomy of the business. Gross margin is calculated by taking the total sales for the company or a product line and subtracting the costs directly associated with making or buying the product or service.
- Every business must earn a return that is greater than the cost of using other people’s money (banks’, shareholders’, or owners’). To keep this truth front and center, many companies today are using a measure called shareholder value added. SVA is a kind of shorthand for judging how well the business is performing overall. Is it or is it not meeting the basic requirements of investors?
- So don't use size as a measure of success. Pushing for more sales dollars isn't necessarily good business. You have to know how and why you're growing. And you have to consider whether you are growing in a way that can continue.
- Look at what is happening to your cash. Maybe sales are increasing, but the cash situation is getting worse. Step back. Are you growing in a way that is gen- erating or consuming cash? Is your profit margin improving or getting worse? money making is improving and the cash is growing too, you have some interesting choices. You If the can use the funds to develop a new product, buy another company, or expand into a new country. Maybe you want to add some new features to make your prod- uct more appealing. Maybe you can cut the price and expand demand profitably.
- The elements of money making cash generation, margin, velocity, return on assets, and growth can all be measured. But people with business acumen don't just memorize these words like terms in a textbook. They understand their real meaning, instinctively sense their relationships to one another, and use them to cre- ate a mental picture. True businesspeople combine the elements of money making to get an intuitive grasp of the total business.
- Exceptional business leaders do what no computer can do. They scan the external environment, and out of all the things that are going on in the world, they are able to identify the significant patterns and trends.
- Business acumen helps a CEO choose the three or four business priorities (no more than five) that will retain customers and achieve all the important money making goals at the same time
  all in the context of the real world.
- Maybe you're an engineer designing a new product. How does it fit into the company's total money-making picture? Will the design please customers and earn a good margin? Does it have the features lots of customers want? Is it preferred by customers over that of a com- ^petitor? Is it going to require new equipment and thus consume cash and reduce velocity? Or is it simply an extension of some existing products and therefore uses equipment or tooling the company already has?
- The main task for the CEO of a publicly traded company goes beyond money making. Shareholders (and employ- ees who receive stock options as part of their compen- sation) expect a CEO to create wealth for them. The best CEOs understand that money making and wealth cre- ation are linked through what is known as the price also called the P-E multiple, or P-E earnings multiple ratio. The P is the price of an individual share of stock. The E is earnings per share —how much profit the company made for each share of stock.
- Find out what your company's P-E multiple is and how the multiple compares to that of its peers and the S&P 500. Then take a minute to reflect: Have you and your company been focused on consistent, predictable, profitable growth; sustainable sources of cash genera- tion; improved margin and/or velocity; and thus return on assets, quarter by quarter? Are all of these combined better than your competitors', and are they improving against that of the S&P 500?
- The investment com- munity tends to reward such CEOs and companies with a higher P-E multiple, which creates tremendous wealth for shareholders. It creates job security and growth opportunities for employees, and wealth for those who receive stock options.
- As any CEO knows well, in business, there are quarterly milestones but there are no finishing lines. Leaders have to deliver results day in, day out, relent- lessly over a long period of time. Delivering results is what gives an organization energy, builds confidence, and generates the resources to go forward.
- Whether you're a CEO, the head of a department, or someone just starting his career, you must be a leader of the business and a leader of people. =A leader of the business knows what to do. A leader of people knows how to get it done:= Harness the efforts of other people, expand their personal capacity, and synchronize their efforts to get results. If you do all that, you get results. That's what I call an edge in execution.
- People who do well in a job also need attention. A true leader of people expands their capacity by helping them channel their skills, develop their abilities, and release their positive energy. Expanding capacity may mean giving the person a "stretch job" that will force him to develop a new skill or gain a new perspective.
- If the person gets the feedback right away and makes the correction, the company will perform better. It's an edge in execution.
- The moment you create that structure, the social interaction in the organization changes. Often, the information that flows from one part of the organization to another gets clogged or distorted. The bigger the company, the harder it is for people to share information, make joint decisions, and adjust their priorities. Decision making slows. The edge in execution gets blunted.
- The lack of synchronization explains why so many small shopkeepers and vendors never expand. They do not know how to create mechanisms that bring people together in a meaningful way, expand their individual capacity, and build the capacity of the total business.
- What are the regional managers observing if they're doing the job right? Not just prices. They're seeing the merchandise, how it is presented, what consumers are buying, what the stores look like, what the ambience is, what new practices competitors are using, and how employees are behaving. Go back to the fundamentals. Remember con- sumers. Who are they and what are they buying? Is your business offering sustainable for the future? You assess through competitive analysis, which for Wal-Mart this was going on constantly.
- Designing Social Operating Mechanisms is a leader- ship task, not a human resources department task. Use your creativity and take it on as a personal challenge.
- You don't have to be a CEO to practice being a leader of the business and a leader of people. Say you're a product line manager. The thought process is the same. Assess the fundamentals of the product line and consider why they are going one way or the other and how they might be improved. When you know what must be done, think about the people around you. Do they have the skills and talents required? How can you coach them? What kind of Social Operating Mechanisms might speed the flow of information and decisions?
- Some of you have the intellectual capacity to cut through complexity but are indecisive or afraid of being wrong. Can you wait until all the facts are in and the picture is clearer? Here's the rub: =You make a bet even when you don't make a bet!= That is, by not choosing to do anything different, you are choosing the status quo.

** Book: The Innovator's Dilemma
** Link: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Innovator%27s_Dilemma
** Notes:
- The research reported in this book supports this latter view: It shows that in the cases of well-managed firms such as those cited above, good management was the most powerful reason they failed to stay atop their industries. Precisely because these firms listened to their customers, invested aggressively in new technologies that would provide their customers more and better products of the sort they wanted, and because they carefully studied market trends and systematically allocated investment capital to innovations that promised the best returns, they lost their positions of leadership.
- Some sustaining technologies can be discontinuous or radical in character, while others are of an incremental nature. =What all sustaining technologies have in common is that they improve the performance of established products, along the dimensions of performance that mainstream customers in major markets have historically valued=. Most technological advances in a given industry are sustaining in character. An important finding revealed in this book is that rarely have even the most radically difficult sustaining technologies precipitated the failure of leading firms.

  Occasionally, however, =disruptive technologies= emerge: =innovations that result in worse product
  performance, at least in the near-term.= Ironically, in each of the instances studied in this book, it was
  disruptive technology that precipitated the leading firms’ failure.
- Principle #1: Companies Depend on Customers and Investors for Resources
- The highest-performing companies, in fact, are those that are the best at this, that is, they have well-developed systems for killing ideas that their customers don’t want. As a result, these companies find it very difficult to invest adequate resources in disruptive technologies—lower-margin opportunities that their customers don’t want—until their customers want them. And by then it is too late.
- Principle #2: Small Markets Don’t Solve the Growth Needs of Large Companies
- Principle #3: Markets that Don’t Exist Can’t Be Analyzed
- In many instances, =leadership in sustaining innovations—about which information is known and for which plans can be made is not competitively important. In such cases, technology followers do about as well as technology leaders. It is in disruptive innovations, where we know least about the market, that there are such strong first-mover advantages.= This is the innovator’s dilemma.
- Principle #4: An Organization’s Capabilities Define Its Disabilities
  An organization’s capabilities reside in two places. The first is in its processes—the methods by which people have learned to transform inputs of labor, energy, materials, information, cash, and technology into outputs of higher value. The second is in the organization’s values, which are the criteria that managers and employees in the organization use when making prioritization decisions.

- Principle #5: Technology Supply May Not Equal Market Demand

- This is one of the innovator’s dilemmas: Blindly following the maxim that good managers should keep close to their customers can sometimes be a fatal mistake.

Step 1: Disruptive Technologies Were First Developed within Established Firms
Step 2: Marketing Personnel Then Sought Reactions from Their Lead Customers
Step 3: Established Firms Step Up the Pace of Sustaining Technological Development
Step 4: New Companies Were Formed, and Markets for the Disruptive Technologies Were Found by
Trial and Error
   "The start-ups, however, were as unsuccessful as their former employers in attracting established
computer makers to the disruptive architecture. Consequently, they had to find new customers."

Step 5: The Entrants Moved Upmarket
Step 6: Established Firms Belatedly Jumped on the Bandwagon to Defend Their Customer Base
#+end_quote

Value Networks HighLights:
  - The context, or value network, in which a firm competes has a profound influence on its ability to
marshal and focus the necessary resources and capabilities to overcome the technological and
organizational hurdles that impede innovation.
  - A key determinant of the probability of an innovative effort’s commercial success is the degree to
which it addresses the well-understood needs of known actors within the value network.
  - Established firms’ decisions to ignore technologies that do not address their customers’ needs
become fatal when two distinct trajectories interact.
  - Entrant firms have an attacker’s advantage over established firms in those innovations—generally
new product architectures involving little new technology per se—that disrupt or redefine the level,
rate, and direction of progress in an established technological trajectory.
  - =At its core, therefore, the issue may be the relative flexibility of successful established firms versus entrant firms to change strategies and cost structures, not
technologies.=
  - The patterns of success and failure we see among firms faced with sustaining and disruptive technology
change are a natural or systematic result of good managerial decisions. That is, in fact, why disruptive
technologies confront innovators with such a dilemma. Working harder, being smarter, investing more
aggressively, and listening more astutely to customers are all solutions to the problems posed by new
sustaining technologies. But these paradigms of sound management are useless—even
counterproductive, in many instances—when dealing with disruptive technology.
  - Why could leading companies migrate so readily toward high-end markets, and why does moving downmarket appear to have been so difficult?
    - Resources Allocation: 
         - the first model: rational, top-down decision-making process in which senior managers weigh alternative
proposals for investment in innovation and put money into those projects that they find to be consistent
with firm strategy and to offer the highest return on investment.
         - the second model: most proposals to innovate are generated from
deep within the organization not from the top. As these ideas bubble up from the bottom, the organization’s middle managers play a critical but invisible role in screening these projects. These
managers can’t package and throw their weight behind every idea that passes by; they need to decide
which are the best, which are most likely to succeed, and which are most likely to be approved, given
the corporate financial, competitive, and strategic climate.

 =This is because, in fact, the best resource allocation systems are designed precisely to weed out ideas that are unlikely to find large, profitable, receptive markets. Any company that doesn’t have a systematic way of targeting its development resources toward customers’ needs, in fact, will fail.=

Even when a senior manager decides to pursue a disruptive technology, the people in the organization are likely to ignore it or, at best, cooperate reluctantly if it doesn’t fit their model of what it takes to succeed as an organization and as individuals within an organization.

- Individuals’ career trajectories can soar when they sponsor highly profitable innovation programs.

** Notes:
Book Recommend:
• _Documenting Software Architectures_ by Len Bass, et al. (Addison-Wesley) is an
excellent book that covers different architectural styles and the corresponding
visual models.
• _Real-Time Software Design_ for Embedded Systems by Hassan Gomaa (Cambridge
University Press) discusses different models and diagrams you can create to
sketch out your system.

WaterFall Model:

The hardware team creates schematics, while the software team works on the devel‐
opment boards. It may seem like the hardware team is taking weeks (or months) to
make a drawing, but most of that time is spent wading through datasheets to find a
component that does what it needs to for the product, at the right price, in the correct
physical dimensions, with a good temperature range, and so on.

Schematics are entered using a schematic capture program (aka CAD package). These
programs are often expensive to license and cumbersome to use, so the hardware
engineer will usually generate a PDF schematic at checkpoints or reviews for your
use.

Because hardware engineers understand that,
most will generate an I/O map that describes the connection attached to each pin of
the processor. Chapter 4 suggests taking the I/O map and making a header file
from it.

How do you know what tests need to be written? It starts with an in-depth knowledge
of the processor and peripherals. That leads to the topic of reading a datasheet.

** Link:https://www.amazon.com/Psychology-Money-Timeless-lessons-happiness/dp/0857197681 
** Notes:
• Luck and risk are siblings. They are both the reality that every outcome in life is
guided by forces other than individual effort.
• This is not an easy problem to solve. The difficulty in identifying what is luck,
what is skill, and what is risk is one of the biggest problems we face when trying
to learn about the best way to manage money.
But two things can point you in a better direction.
    /Be careful who you praise and admire. Be careful who you look down upon and wish to avoid becoming./

    =Therefore, focus less on specific individuals and case studies and more on broad pattern.=

/Bill Gates once said, “Success is a lousy teacher. It seduces smart people into
thinking they can’t lose.”/

• Failure can be a lousy teacher, because it seduces smart people into thinking
their decisions were terrible when sometimes they just reflect the unforgiving
realities of risk. The trick when dealing with failure is arranging your financialrealities of risk. The trick when dealing with failure is arranging your financial
life in a way that a bad investment here and a missed financial goal there won’t
wipe you out so you can keep playing until the odds fall in your favor.

# 1. The hardest financial skill is getting the goalpost to stop moving.

(Happiness, as it’s said, is just results minus expectations.)


# 2. Social comparison is the problem here.

# 3. “Enough” is not too little.

# 4. There are many things never worth risking, no matter the potential gain.

• The big takeaway from ice ages is that you don’t need tremendous force to
create tremendous results.

    * But there’s only one way to stay wealthy: some combination of frugality and paranoia.

# Getting money is one thing. Keeping it is another.

    * Compounding only works if you can give an asset years and years to grow. It’s like planting oak trees: A year of growth will never show much progress, 10 years can make a meaningful difference, and 50 years can create something absolutely extraordinary.absolutely extraordinary.
    * Nassim Taleb put it this way: “Having an ‘edge’ and surviving are two different things: the first requires the second. You need to avoid ruin. At all costs.”

# 1. More than I want big returns, I want to be financially unbreakable. And if I’m unbreakable I actually think I’ll get the biggest returns, because I’ll be able to stick around long enough for compounding to work wonders.

# 2. Planning is important, but the most important part of every plan is to plan on the plan not going according to plan.

=(A plan is only useful if it can survive reality. And a future filled with unknowns
is everyone’s reality.)=

A good plan doesn’t pretend this weren’t true; it embraces it and emphasizes
room for error. The more you need specific elements of a plan to be true, the
more fragile your financial life becomes. If there’s enough room for error in your
savings rate that you can say, “It’d be great if the market returns 8% a year over
the next 30 years, but if it only does 4% a year I’ll still be OK,” the more
valuable your plan becomes.

# 3. A barbelled personality—optimistic about the future, but paranoid about what will prevent you from getting to the future—is vital.

A mindset that can be paranoid and optimistic at the same time is hard to
maintain, because seeing things as black or white takes less effort than accepting
nuance. But you need short-term paranoia to keep you alive long enough to
exploit long-term optimism.

Anything that is huge, profitable, famous, or influential is the result of a tail
event—an outlying one-in-thousands or millions event. And most of our
attention goes to things that are huge, profitable, famous, or influential. When
most of what we pay attention to is the result of a tail, it’s easy to underestimatemost of what we pay attention to is the result of a tail, it’s easy to underestimate
how rare and powerful they are.

A good definition of an investing genius is the man or woman who can do the
average thing when all those around them are going crazy.

Tails drive everything.


# Controlling your time is the highest dividend money pays.

The ability to do what you want, when you want, with who you want, for as long
as you want, is priceless. It is the highest dividend money pays.

Having a strong sense of controlling one’s life is a more dependable predictor of
positive feelings of wellbeing than any of the objective conditions of life we
have considered.

More than your salary. More than the size of your house. More than the prestige
of your job. =Control over doing what you want, when you want to, with the
people you want to, is the broadest lifestyle variable that makes people happy.=

Money’s greatest intrinsic value—and this can’t be overstated—is its ability to
give you control over your time.

# No one is impressed with your possessions as much as you are.

people tend to want wealth to signal to others that they
should be liked and admired. But in reality those other people often bypass
admiring you, not because they don’t think wealth is admirable, but because they
use your wealth as a benchmark for their own desire to be liked and admired.


# Spending money to show people how much money you have is the fastest way to have less money.

The only way to be wealthy is to not spend the money that you do have. It’s not just the only way to
accumulate wealth; it’s the very definition of wealth.

But wealth is hidden. It’s income not spent. Wealth is an option not yet taken to
buy something later. Its value lies in offering you options, flexibility, and growth
to one day purchase more stuff than you could right now.

Wealth is turning down that treat meal and actually
burning net calories. It’s hard, and requires self-control. But it creates a gap
between what you could do and what you choose to do that accrues to you over
time.

# save money 

The first idea—simple, but easy to overlook—is that building wealth has
little to do with your income or investment returns, and lots to do with your
savings rate.

Learning to be happy with less money creates a
gap between what you have and what you want—similar to the gap you get from
growing your paycheck, but easier and more in your control.

That flexibility and control over your time is an unseen return on wealth.

Things that have
never happened before happen all the time.

Two dangerous things happen when you rely too heavily on investment history
as a guide to what’s going to happen next.

# 1. You’ll likely miss the outlier events that move the needle the most.

The most important part of every plan is planning on your plan not going according to plan.

Use room for error when estimating your future returns.

You can be risk loving and yet completely averse to ruin.

The idea is that you have to take risk to get ahead, but no risk that can wipe you
out is ever worth taking.

You
can’t prepare for what you can’t envision.

We should avoid the extreme ends of financial planning. Assuming you’ll be
happy with a very low income, or choosing to work endless hours in pursuit
of a high one, increases the odds that you’ll one day find yourself at a point
of regret. The fuel of the End of History Illusion is that people adapt to most
circumstances, so the benefits of an extreme plan—the simplicity of having
hardly anything, or the thrill of having almost everything—wear off. But
the downsides of those extremes—not being able to afford retirement, or
looking back at a life spent devoted to chasing dollars—become enduring
regrets. Regrets are especially painful when you abandon a previous plan
and feel like you have to run in the other direction twice as fast to make up
for lost time.

Everything has a price, but not all prices appear on labels.

Find the price, then pay it.

Beware taking financial cues from people playing a different game than you are.

Investors often innocently take cues from other
investors who are playing a different game than they are.

Optimism sounds like a sales pitch. Pessimism sounds like someone trying to help you.

=Tell someone that everything will be great and they’re likely to either shrug you off or offer a skeptical eye. Tell someone they’re in danger and you have their undivided attention.=

=A third is that progress happens too slowly to notice, but setbacks happen too quickly to ignore.=

This same thing applies to business, where it takes years to realize how
important a product or company is, but failures can happen overnight.

The more you want something to be true, the more likely you are to
believe a story that overestimates the odds of it being true.

Everyone has an incomplete view of the world. But we form a complete
narrative to fill in the gaps.

Both in explaining the past and in predicting the future, we focus on the causal
role of skill and neglect the role of luck.

If you want to do better as an investor, the single most powerful thing you
can do is increase your time horizon. Time is the most powerful force in
investing. It makes little things grow big and big mistakes fade away. It
can’t neutralize luck and risk, but it pushes results closer towards what
people deserve.

Use money to gain control over your time, because not having control of
your time is such a powerful and universal drag on happiness. The ability to
do what you want, when you want, with who you want, for as long as you
want to, pays the highest dividend that exists in finance.

** Book: The Second Law: Resolving the Mystery of the Second Law of Thermodynamics
** Link: https://www.amazon.com/Second-Law-Resolving-Mystery-Thermodynamics/dp/1579550835
** Notes:
 * Entropy increases. Mechanical work irreversibly turns into heat.
 * In its usual conception, the Second Law is a law of thermodynamics, concerned with the
    dynamics of heat. But it turns out that there’s a vast generalization of it that’s possible. And
    in fact my key realization is that =the Second Law is ultimately just a manifestation of the very same core computational phenomenon that is at the heart of our Physics Project and indeed the whole conception of science that is emerging from our study of the ruliad and the
    multicomputational paradigm.=
 * instead, it’s perfectly possible for randomness to be generated intrinsically within
a system just through the process of applying definite underlying rules.
 *  the Principle of Computational Equivalence,
which states that above some low threshold, systems always end up being equivalent in the
sophistication of the computations they perform.
 * But the key point
(emphasized by our Physics Project) is that observers like us are computationally bounded
in our capabilities. And this means that we’re not able to “see through the computational
irreducibility’—with the result that the behavior we see “looks random to us”.
 * At an everyday level, the core manifestation of the Second Law is the tendency of things to
“degrade” to randomness.
 * But what does it mean to “recognize regularities”? In essence it’s all about seeing if we can
find succinct ways to summarize what we see—or at least the aspects of what we see that we
care about.
 * The fundamental point is that there seems to be enough computa-
tional irreducibility in the evolution of the system that no computationally bounded observer
can “see through it”. And so—at least as far as a computationally bounded observer is
concerned—“specialness” in the initial conditions is quickly “degraded” to an “equilibrium”
state that “seems random’. Or, in other words, the computational process of evolution
inevitably seems to lead to the core phenomenon of the Second Law.
 * The Concept of Entropy
“Entropy increases” is a common statement of the Second Law. But what does this mean,
especially in our computational context?

 * The entropy can be thought of as counting the number of possible microscopic states of the
system that are consistent with some overall constraint—like a certain number of particles in
each bin. If the constraint talks specifically about the position of every particle, there’ll only
be one microscopic state consistent with the constraints, and the entropy will be zero. But if
the constraint is looser, there’ll often be many possible microscopic states consistent with it,
and the entropy we define will be nonzero.

 * For in our Physics Project we imagine that at the
lowest level everything in our universe can be represented by some essentially computational
structure, conveniently described as a hypergraph whose nodes are abstract “atoms of
space”. This structure evolves by following rules, whose operation will typically show all sorts
of computational irreducibility.

 * At some level we can think of the Second Law as being a consequence of the dynamics of a
system so “encrypting” the initial conditions of a system that no computations available to
an “observer” can feasibly “decrypt” it.

 * As we've seen, there are a variety of “indicators” of the operation of the Second Law. Some
are based on looking for randomness or compression in individual states. Others are based
on computing coarse grainings and entropy measures. But with the computational interpre-
tation of the Second Law we can expect to translate such indicators into questions in areas
like computational complexity theory.

 * The First Law of thermodynamics asserted that heat was a form of energy, and that overall
energy was conserved. The Second Law then tried to characterize the nature of the energy
associated with heat. And a core idea was that this energy was somehow incoherently spread
among a large number of separate microscopic components. But ultimately thermodynam-
ics was always a story of energy.

 * At a computational level, the analog of “mechanical
work” is systematic, predictable behavior. So what this is saying is again that systems tend to
generate randomness, and to “remove predictability”.

 * The concept of entropy, as we’ve discussed, is ultimately a computational
concept, quite independent of physical notions like energy. In many textbook treatments of
thermodynamics, energy and entropy are in some sense put on a similar footing. The First
Law is about energy. The Second Law is about entropy. But what we’ve seen here is that
energy is really a concept at a different level from entropy: it’s something one gets to “layer
on” in discussing physical systems, but it’s not a necessary part of the “computational
essence” of how things work.

 * But we don't have to go all the way to a sophisti-
cated “mind” to see this picture in operation. Because it’s already what's going on not only in
something like perception but also in essentially anything we’d usually call “measurement”.

 * The universe does not fundamentally just “descend into randomness”. And indeed all the
things that exist in our universe today will ultimately be encoded in some way forever in the
detailed structure that develops.
 * At its core, the Second Law is about evolution from orderly “simple” initial conditions to
apparent randomness.
 * The Second Law is ultimately a story of the mismatch between the computational irreducibil-
ity of underlying systems, and the computational boundedness of observers like us.

 * the Second Law is a reflection of avery general, if
deeply computational, idea: an interplay between computational irreducibility and the
computational limitations of observers like us.


** Book: The Science of Success: The Secret to Getting What You Want
** Link: https://www.amazon.com/Science-Success-Secret-Getting-What/dp/1402753144
** Notes:
 * The Science of Getting Rich
   * The monistic theory of the universe, read Hegel and Emerson for himself.
   * The purpose of Nature is the advancement and unfoldment of life; and every man should have all that can contribute to the power; elegance, beauty, and richness of life; to be content with less is sinful.
   * Success in life is becoming what you want to be; you can become what you want to be only by making use of things, and you can have the free use of things only as you become rich enough to buy them.
   * It is in the use of material things that a man finds full life for his body, develops his mind, and unfolds his soul. It is therefore of supreme importance to him that he should be rich.
   * Getting rich is the result of doing things in a Certain Way.
   * Getting rich is not dependent upon your engaging in some particular business, but upon your learning to do things in a Certain Way.
   * =At different periods the tide ofopportunity sets in A different directions, according to the needs of the whole and the particular stage ofsocial evolution which has been reached.=
# fllow the tide of opportunity 
   * We is no limit to the supply ofFormless Stuff, or Original Substance.

   THE FIRST PRINCIPLE IN THE SCIENCE OF GETTING RICH 

    * In creating, the Formless seems to move according to the lines of motion it has established.
    * Man is a thinking center, and can originate thought. All the forms that man fashions with his hands must first exist in his thought; he cannot shape a thing until he has thought that thing.
    * There is a thinking stuff from which all things are made, and which, in its original state, permeates, penetrates, and fills the interstices of the universe. A thought, in this substance, Produces the thing that is imaged by the thought. Man can form things in his thought, and, by impressing his thought upon formless substance, can cause the thing he thinks about to be created.
    * Man can form things in his thought, and, by impressing his thought upon formless substance, can cause the thing he thinks about to be created.
    * =and in order to do so, men must become able to think in a Certain Way. A man’s way of doing things is the direct result of the way he thinks about things.=
    * To think what you want to think is to think TRUTH, regardless of appearances.
    * Man can form things in his thought, and, by impressing his thought upon formless substance, can cause the thing he thinks about to be created.
    * =Every living thing must continually seek for the enlargement of its life, because life, in the mere act of living, must increase itself.=
    * Intelligence is under this same necessity for continuous increase. Every thought we think makes it necessary for us to think another thought; consciousness is continually expanding. Every fact we learn leads us to the learning of another fact; knowledge is continually increasing. Every talent we cultivate brings to the mind the desire to cultivate another talent; we are subject to the urge oflife, seeking expression, which ever drives us on to know more, to do more, and to be more.
    * The One Substance desires to live more in you; hence it wants you to have all the things you can use.
    * The universe desires you to have everything you want to have. Nature is friendly to your plans.
    * Everything is naturally for you. Make up your mind that this is true.
    * You can make the most of yourself only by getting rich; so it is right and praiseworthy that you should give your first and best thought to the work of acquiring wealth.
    * You are to become a creator, not a competitor; you are going to get what you want, but in such a way that when you get it every other man will have more than he has now.
    * You must rise entirely out of the competitive thought. You must never think for a moment that the supply is limited.
    * You must never think for a moment that the supply is limited. Just as soon as you begin to think that all the money is being “cornered” and controlled by bankers and others, and that you must exert yourselftoget laws passed to stop this process, and so on; in that moment you drop into the competitive mind, and your power to cause creation is gone for the time being...

    The three fundamental propositions:

    1. There is a thinking stuff from which all things are made, and which, in its original state, permeates, penetrates, and fills the interspaces ofthe universe.
    2. A thought, in this substance, produces the thing that is imaged by the thought.
    3. Man can form things in his thought, and, by impressing his thought upon formless substance, can cause the thing he thinks about to be created.

     When you rise from the competitive to the creative plane, you can scan your business transactions very strictly, and if you are selling any man anything which does not add more to his life than the thing he give you in exchange, you can afford to stop it. You do not have to beat anybody in business. And if you are in a business which does beat people, get out of it at once.  
       
    You cannot give every man more in cash market value than you take from him, but you can give him more in use value than the cash value of the thing you take from him.

    * God wants all these things because it is Himself that enjoys and appreciates them; it is God who wants to play, and sing, and enjoy beauty, and proclaim truth and wear fine clothes, and eat good foods. “It is God that worketh in you to will and to do,” said Paul.
    * the first step toward getting rich is to convey the idea of your wants to the Formless Substance.
    * First, you believe that there is one Intelligent Substance, from which all things proceed; second, you believe that this Substance gives you everything you desire; and third, you relate yourself to it by a feeling of deep and profound gratitude.
    * Gratitude will lead your mind out along the ways by which things come; and it will keep you in close harmony with creative thought and prevent you from falling into competitive thought.
    * Gratitude alone can keep you looking toward the All, and prevent you from falling into the error of thinking of the supply as limited; for to do that would be fatal to your hopes.
    * But the value of gratitude does not consist solely in getting you more blessings in the future. Without gratitude you cannot long keep from dissatisfied thought regarding things as they are.
    * The moment you permit your mind to dwell with dissatisfaction upon things as they are, you begin to lose ground. You fix attention upon the common, the ordinary, the poor, and the squalid and mean; and your mind takes the form ofthese things.
    * The reaction of gratitude upon one’s own mind produces faith; and every outgoing wave ofgrateful thanksgiving increases faith. He who has no feeling ofgratitude cannot long retain a living faith; and without a living faith you cannot get rich by the creative method.
    * You must form a clear and definite mental picture of what you want; you cannot transmit an idea unless you have it yourself.
    * When you try to impress your wants upon Substance, remember that it must be done by a coherent statement; you must know what you want, and be definite. You can never get rich, or start the creative power into action, by sending out unformed longings and vague desires.
    * That clear mental picture you must have continually in mind, as the sailor has in mind the port toward which he is sailing the ship; you must keep your face toward it all the time. You must no more lose sight of it than the steersman loses sight of the compass.
    * When you try to impress your wants upon Substance, remember that it must be done by a coherent statement; you must know what you want, and be definite.
    * Behind your clear vision must be the purpose to realize it; to bring it out in tangible expression.
    * Whatsoever things you ask for when you pray, believe that you receive them, and ye shall have them,” said Jesus.
    * The man who can sincerely thank God for the things which as yet he owns only in imagination, has real faith. He will get rich; he will cause the creation of whatsoever he wants. You do not need to pray repeatedly for things you want;
    * Your part is to intelligently formulate your desire for the things which make for a larger life, and to get the desire arranged into a coherent whole; and then to impress this Whole Desire upon the Formless Substance, which has the power and the will to bring you what you want.
    * You do not make this impression by repeating strings of words; you make it by holding the vision with unshakable PURPOSE to attain it, and with steadfast FAITH that you do attain it.
    * Imagine an environment and afinancial condition exactly as you want them, and live all the time in that imaginary environment and financial condition.
    * The whole matter turns on receiving, once you have clearly formed your vision. When you have formed it, it is well to make an oral statement, addressing the Supreme in reverent prayer; and from that moment you must, in mind, receive what you ask for. Live in the new house; wear the fine clothes; ride in the automobile; go on the jour- ney, and confidently plan for greater journeys. Think and speak of all the things you have asked for in terms of actual present owner- ship. Imagine an environment and a financial condition exactly as you want them, and live all the time in that imaginary environment and financial condition. Mind, however, that you do not do this as a mere dreamer and castle builder; hold to the FAITH that the imaginary is being realized, and to the PURPOSE to realize it.
    * To set about getting rich in a scientific way, you do not try to apply your willpower to anything outside of yourself.
    * indeed, any attempt to use your will upon others will only tend to defeat your purpose.
    * To get rich, you need only to use your willpower upon yourself.
    * You have no right to use your willpower upon another person, even “for his own good’; for you do not know what isfor his good.
    * every hour in which your soul is possessed by unbelief, sets a current away from you in the whole domain of intelligent Substance.
    * Since beliefisall important, it behooves you to guard your thoughts; and as your beliefs will be shaped to a very great extent by the things you observe and think about, it is important that you should command your attention.
    * Doubt or unbeliefisas certain to start a movement away from you as faith and purpose are to start one toward you. It is by not understanding this that most people who try to make use of“mental science” in getting rich make their failure.
    * And here the will comes into use; for it is by your will that you determine upon what things your attention shall be fixed.
    * Things are not brought into being by thinking about their opposites.
    * What concerns you is the cure.
    * If you want to help the poor, demonstrate to them that they can become rich; prove it by getting rich yourself.
    * YOU cannot retain a true and clear vision of wealth if you are constantly turning your attention to opposing pictures, whether they be external or imaginary.
    * Do not tell of your past troubles of a financial nature, if you have had them, do not think of them at all. Do no tell of the poverty of your parents, or the hardships of your early life; to do any of these things is to mentally class yourself with the poor for the time being, and it will certainly check the movement of things in your direction.
    * “Let the dead bury their dead,” as Jesus said. Put poverty and all things that pertain to poverty completely behind you.
    * Why give time and attention to things which are being removed by evolutionary growth, when you can hasten their removal only by promoting the evolutionary growth as far as your part of it goes?
    * Whenever you think or speak of those who are poor, think and speak of them as those who are becoming rich; as those who are to be congratulated rather than pitied. Then they and others will catch the inspiration, and begin to search for the way out.
    * You can aim at nothing so great or noble, I repeat, as to become rich; and you must fix your attention upon your mental picture ofriches, to the exclusion of all that may tend to dim or obscure the vision.
    * Some people remain in poverty because they are ignorant of the fact that there is wealth for them; and these can best be taught by showing them the way to affluence in your own person and practice.
    * If your heart is set on domestic happiness, remember that love flourishes best where there is refinement, a high level of thought, and freedom from corrupting influences; and these are to be found only where riches are attained by the exercise of creative thought, without strife or rivalry.
    * There is only one way to think scientifically, and that is to think in the way that leads by the most direct and simple route to the goal.
    * man must not only think, but his personal action must supplement his thought.
    * By thought you can cause the gold in the hearts of the mountains to be impelled toward you; but it will not mine itself, refine itself, coin itself into double eagles, and come rolling along the roads seeking its way into your pocket.
    * all you have to do with that is to retain your vision, stick to your purpose, and maintain your faith and gratitude.
    * By thought, the thing you want is brought to you; by action you receive it.
    * Whatever your action is to be, it is evident that you must act NOW.
    * If you act in the present with your mind on the future, your present action will be with a divided mind, and will not be effective.
    * Put your whole mind into present action.
    * Do not bother as to whether yesterday’s work was well done or ill done; do today’s work well.
    * Do not wait for a change ofenvironment before you act; get a change ofenvironment by action.
    * Do not cast about seeking some new thing to do, or some strange, unusual, or remarkable action to perform as a first step toward getting rich.
    * =If you are engaged in some business, and feel that it is not the right one for you, do not wait until you get into the right business before you begin to act.=
    * Hold the vision ofyourself in the right business, with the purpose to get into it, and the faith that you will get into it, and are getting into it; but ACT in your present business.
    * Your vision of the right business, if held with faith and purpose, will cause the Supreme to move the right business toward you; and your action, if performed in the Certain Way, will cause you to move toward the business.
    * You must use your thought as directed in previous chapters, and begin to do what you can do where you are; and you must do ALL that you can do where you are.
    * The world is advanced only by those who more than fill their present places.
    * Every day is either a successful day or a day of failure; and it is the successful days which get you what you want. If every day is a failure, you can never get rich; while if every day is a success, you cannot fail to get rich.
    * =If there is something that may be done today, and you do not do it, you have failed in so far as that thing is concerned; and the consequences may be more disastrous than you imagine.=
    * Do, every day, ALL that can be done that day.
    * It is really not the number of things you do, but the EFFICIENCY of each separate action that counts.
    * Every act is, in itself, either a success or a failure.
    * Every act is, in itself, either effective or inefficient.
    * Every inefficient act is a failure, and if you spend your life in doing inefficient acts, your whole life will be a failure.
    * The more things you do, the worse for you, if all your acts are inefficient ones.
    * On the other hand, every efficient act is a success in itself, and if every act of your life is an efficient one, your whole life MUST be a success.
    * The cause of failure is doing too many things in an inefficient manner, and not doing enough things in an efficient manner.
    * ALL Power is working with you; and ALL Power cannot fail.
    * Every action is either strong or weak; and when every one is strong, you are acting in the Certain Way which will make you rich.
    * Every act can be made strong and efficient by holding your vision while you are doing it, and putting the whole power of your FAITH and PURPOSE into it.
    * =Do, every day, all that you can do that day, and do each act in an efficient manner.=
    * SUCCESS, in any particular business, depends for one thing upon your possessing in a well-developed state the faculties required in that business.
    * Generally speaking, you will do best in that business which will use your strongest faculties; the one for which you are naturally “best fitted.”
    * you will get rich most satisfactorily if you do that which you WANT to do.
    * Desire is a manifestation of power.
    * The best way, generally, to change business or environment is by growth.
    * There is never any hurry on the creative plane; and there is no lack of opportunity.
    * and by =all means, in times of doubt and indecision, cultivate gratitude.=
    * the key-thought of all your efforts must be to convey to their minds the impression of increase.
    * Increase is what all men and all women are seeking; it is the urge of the Formless Intelligence within them, seeking fuller expression.
    * You are a creative center, from which increase is given off to all.
    * You can convey this impression by holding the unshakable faith that you, yourself, are in the Way ofIncrease; and by letting this faith inspire, fill, and permeate every action.
    * Feel that you are getting rich, and that in so doing you are making others rich, and conferring benefits on all.
    * =You must so impress others that they will feel that in associating with you they will get increase for themselves. See that you give them a use value greater than the cash value you are taking from them.=
    * Take an honest pride in doing this, and let everybody know it; and you will have no lack of customers.
    * Beware of the insidious temptation to seek for power over other men.
    * if you can give increase of life to others and make them sensible of the fact, they will be attracted to you, and you will get rich.
    * Form your clear mental vision of what you want, and begin to act with faith and purpose. Do all the work you can do, every day, and do each piece of work inaperfectly successful manner; put the power of success, and the purpose to get rich, into everything that you do.
    * Men will be attracted to you, and if there is no possibility for advancement in your present job, you will very soon see an opportunity to take another job.
    * There is a Power which never fails to present opportunity to the Advane- ing Man who is moving in obedience to law.
    * Do not wait for an opportunity to be all that you want to be; when an opportunity to be more than you are now is presented and you feel impelled toward it, take it.
    * If the people have the Advancing Mind, have the Faith that they can become rich, and move forward with the fixed purpose to become rich, nothing can possibly keep them in poverty.
    * Train yourself to think of and to look upon the world as something which is Becoming, which is growing: and to regard seeming evil as being only that which is undeveloped.
    * =When you make a failure, it is because you have not asked for enough; keep on, and a larger thing than you were seeking will certainly come to you. Remember this.=
    * However, do not hesitate or waver for fear that when you come to any certain place you will fail for lack of ability; keep right on, and when you come to that place, the ability will be furnished to you.
    * The man who wishes to get rich must spend his leisure hours in contemplating his Vision, and in earnest thanks- giving that the reality is being given to him.
    * Man must form a clear and definite mental image of the things he wishes to have, to do, or to become; and he must hold this mental image in his thoughts, while being deeply grateful to the Supreme that all his desires are granted to him.
    * He must keep in mind the Purpose to get rich through the realization of his mental image. And he must do, every day, all that can be done that day, taking care to do each act in a successful manner.

    The Science Of Being Well:

    * You getting well does not depend upon the adoption of some system, or the finding ofsome remedy; people with your identical ailments have been healed by all systems and all remedies.
    * The voluntary functions of life are eating, drinking, breathing, and sleeping. These, entirely or in part, are under the direction of a person’s conscious mind; and they can perform them in a perfectly healthy way ifthey will. Ifthey do not perform them in a healthy way, they cannot long be well.
    * Man cannot hope to be well by thinking health if he eats, drinks, breathes, and sleeps like a sick man.
    * The best way to do this is to form mental image or picture ofyourselfas being well, imagining a perfectly strong and healthy body; and to spend sufficient time in contemplating this image to make it your habitual thought ofyourself. This is not so easy as it sounds; it necessitates the taking of considerable time for meditation, and not all persons have the imaging faculty well enough developed to form a distinct mental picture of themselves in a perfect or idealized body.
    * Man’s liver is not controlled by a liver-principle, his stomach by a digestive principle, and so on; the Principle of Health is One.
    * Hold with persistence to the thought ofperfect health in H relation to yourself; do not permit yourself to think in any other way.
    * You have a mind-body and a physical body; the mind-body takes form just as you think ofyourself, and any thought which you hold continuously is made visible by the transformation of the physical body into its image.
    * Having faith in health, and applying it to yourself, means having faith that you are healthy; and the first step in this is to claim that it is the truth.
    * Whenever suggestions ofdisease are coming thick and fast upon you, and you are in a “tight place,” fall back upon the exercise of gratitude.
    * Exercise your willpower in choosing only those thoughts which are thoughts ofhealth, and arrange your environment so that it shall suggest thoughts ofhealth.
    * Wisdom is the power to perceive truth, and the ability to make the best use of the knowledge of truth.
    * if you are in mental harmony with the Supreme, the forces which make for life begin to concentrate about you and upon you. The One Life begins to move toward you, and your environment becomes surcharged with it. Then, if you appropriate it by faith, it is yours. “Ye shall ask what ye will, and it shall be done unto you.” Your Father giveth not his spirit by measure; he delights to give good gifts to you.
    * LET me now summarize the mental actions and attitudes necessary to the practice of the Science of Being Well; first, you believe that there is a Thinking Substance, from which all things are made, and which, in its original state, permeates, penetrates, and fills the interspaces of the universe. This Substance is the Life of All, and is seeking to express more life in all. It is the Principle of Life of the universe, and the Principle of Health in man.
    * Claim health as a blessing bestowed upon you by the ‘or Supreme Life, and be deeply grateful at all times.
    * In sleep the body is recharged with vital power, and the assimilation of the food which has been taken during the day is completed; the system has no need for food immediately after sleep, unless the person went to their rest in a state of starvation.
    * Always eat when you are hungry; and never eat when you are not hungry. This is obedience to nature, which is obedience to God.
    * Do not fix your attention on the act of chewing; fix it D on the TASTE of the food; and taste and enjoy it until it is reduced to a liquid state and passes down your throat by involuntary swallowing.
    * When you find that your mind is wandering, call a halt; think for a moment of the food, and ofhow good it tastes; ofthe perfect digestion and assimilation that are going to follow the meal, and begin again.
    * In the matter of how much to eat, you will also see that I there could be no other guide so natural, so safe, and so reliable as the one I have prescribed—to stop eating the instant you feel that your hunger begins to abate.
    * =The thought ofa condition produces that condition; the thought ofa motion institutes that motion.=
    * Do not allow yourself to think that you are compelled to live or work where the air is not fit to breathe. If your house cannot be properly ventilated, move; and ifyou are employed where the air is bad, get another job.
    * Observe these requirements, go to sleep in a thankful and confident frame ofmind, and all will be well.
    * Guard your speech; make every word harmonize with the conception ofperfect health.
    * While you rest do not think ofyour present weakness; think ofthe strength that is coming.
    * If man will consciously accept the health which is being continually given to him by the Living Substance, and if he will be duly grateful therefore, he will develop faith.


    The Science Of Being Great:
    * Nothing that man can think is impossible in action. Nothing that man can imagine is impos- sible of realization.
    * Man is formed for growth, and he is under the necessity of growing. It is essential to his happiness that he should continuously advance.
    * Man has an inherent power by which he may grow in whatsoever direction he pleases, and there does not appear to be any limit to the possibilities ofhis growth.
    * The Principle of Power in him is in constant action. He is self-active. “He hath life in himself.”
    * AIl the experiences of life are designed by Providence to force men and women into self-activity; to compel them to cease being creatures ofcircumstances and master their environment.
    * Nothing was ever in any man that is not in you; no man ever had more spiritual or mental power than you can attain, or did greater things than you can accomplish. You can become what you want to be.
    * The brain does not make the man; the man makes the brain.
    * Your place in life is not fixed by heredity.
    * The power which formed man and purposed him for growth also controls the circumstances ofsociety, industry, and government; and this power is never divided against itself.
    * Wisdom is the power to perceive the best ends to aim at and the best means for reaching those ends. It is the power to perceive the right thing to do.
    * Any man who develops the power to perceive truth, and who can show that he always knows the right thing to do and that he can be trusted to do the right thing, will be honored and advanced; the whole world is looking eagerly for such men.
    * The brain does not think, the man thinks and expresses his thought through the brain.
    * Nature is as intelligent as man, and knows more than N man; nature knows all things. The All-Mind has been in touch with all things from the beginning; and it contains all knowledge.
    * Man is a thinking substance, a portion of the Cosmic Substance; but man is limited, while the Cosmic Intelligence from which he sprang, which Jesus calls the Father, is unlimited.
    * IF you become like God you can read his thoughts; and if you do not you will find the inspirational perception of truth impossible. You can never become a great man or woman until you have overcome anxiety, worry, and fear. It is impossible for an anxious person, a worried one, or a fearful one to perceive truth; all things are distorted and thrown out of their proper relations by such mental states, and those who are in them cannot read the thoughts of God.
    * You must cast out lust, and cease to be ruled by appetite, and you must begin to govern appetite. You must eat only to satisfy hunger, never for gluttonous pleasure, and in all things you must make the flesh obey the spirit.
    * Faith—not a faith in one’s self or in one’s own powers but faith in prin- ciple; in the Something Great which upholds right, and which may be relied upon to give us the victory in due time. Without this faith it is not possible for anyone to rise to real greatness.
    * The man who has no faith in principle will always be a small man. Whether you have this faith or not depends upon your point of view. You must learn to see the world as being produced by evolution; as a something which is evolving and becoming, not as a finished work.
    * =THIS MUST BE YOUR POINT OF VIEW: THAT THE WORLD AND ALLIT CONTAINS IS PERFECT, THOUGH NOT COMPLETED.=
    * You must learn not to look upon the world as a lost and decaying thing but as a something perfect and glorious which is going on to a most beautiful completeness; and you must learn to see men and women not as lost and accursed things, but as perfect beings advancing to become complete.
    * Intellect helps us to see the best means and manner ofdoing the right thing, but intellect never shows us the right thing. Intellec and reason serve the selfish man for his selfish ends as readily as they serve the unselfish man for his unselfish ends.
    * If you desire to advance, and you are not doing so, remember that it can be only because your thought is better than your practice. You must do as well as you think. Let your thoughts be ruled by principle, and then live up to your thoughts.
    * Man is surrounded by a Mind which knows all there is to know, past, present, and to come.
    * Intelligence is one and the same everywhere, and must be everywhere an attribute ofthe same substance. There cannot be one kind ofintelligence in God and another kind of intelligence in man; intelligence can only be in intelligent substance, and Intelligent Substance is God.
    * This is a fact that you should impress upon your understanding—that a thought held in thinking substance is a real thing; a form, and has actual existence, although it is not visible to you. You internally take the form in which you think of yourself; and you surround yourself with the invisible forms of those things with which you associate in your thoughts.
    * If you desire a thing, picture it clearly and hold the picture steadily in mind until it becomes a definite thought-form; and ifyour practices are not such as to separate you from God, the thing you want will come to you in material form. It must do so in obedience to the law by which the universe was created.
    * This is a fact that you should impress upon your understanding—that a thought held in thinking substance is a real thing; a form, and has actual existence, although it is not visible to you.
    * DO NOT LET OTHER PEOPLE DECIDE WHAT YOU ARE TO BE. BE WHAT YOU FEEL THAT YOU WANT TO BE.
    * Be true to yourself, and you cannot then be false to be any man. When you have fully decided what thing you want to be, form the highest conception of that thing that you are capable ofimagining, and make that conception a thought-form.
    * Two things are necessary. First, the making of the thought-form, and, second, the actual appropriation to yourself of all that goes into and around the thought-form.
    * You must put the whole power of your great soul into every act,
    * Next, and most important, you must have absolute faith in your own perceptions oftruth. =Never act in haste or hurry; be deliberate in everything; wait until you feel that you know the true way.=
    * The one way to develop a perception oftruth in large things is to trust absolutely to your present perception oftruth in small things.
    * Hurry is a manifestation of fear; he who fears not has plenty of time. If you act with perfect faith in your own perceptions of truth, you will never be too late or too early; and nothing will go wrong.
    * =Nothing can go wrong in this world but yourself; and you can go wrong only by getting into the wrong mental attitude.=
    * Whatever you habitually think yourself to be, that You are. You must form, now, a greater and better habit; you must form a conception ofyourself as a being of limitless power, and habitually think that you are that being.
    * What you must do is to repeat the new thought ofyourself until it is the only way in which you think ofyourself. Habitual thought, and not environment or circumstance, has made you what you are.
    * Read less and think more. Read about great things and think about great questions and issues.
    * No amount of education, reading, or study can make you great without thought; but thought can make you great with very little study.
    * Thinking is growth; you cannot think without growing. Every thought engenders another thought. Write one idea and others will follow until you have written a page.
    * Environment is the result of thought
    * Environment is the result of thought; things group themselves or arrange themselves around you according to your thought.
    * Consider that there is one great, perfect, intelligent Principle of Life and Power, causing all the changing phenomena of the cosmos. Think about all this until you see that it is true, and until you comprehend how you should live and act as a citizen ofsuch a perfect whole.
    * Great thoughts will manifest in a great personality. Think well of all this, and then you are ready to act.
    * Rely absolutely on your perception of truth. Trust to the inner light rather than to reason,
    * Greatness is reward enough for itself; the joy of being something and ofknowing that you are advancing is the greatest of all joys possible to man.
    * Live a great life where you are, and in the daily work you have to do, and greater works will surely find you out. Big things will come to you, asking to be done.
    * God does not lack anything that men may dofor him with their hands or bodies or voices.
    * Your first duty to God, to yourself, and to the world is to make yourselfasgreat a personality, in every way, as you possibly can. And that, it seems to me, disposes of the question of duty.
    * A mental exercise is an exercise, not in repeating words, but in the thinking of certain thoughts.
    * The purpose in taking a mental exercise is that you may think certain thoughts repeatedly until you form a habit of thinking them; then they will be your thoughts all the time.
    * He must reach the right viewpoint, recognizing that God is all, in all, and that there is nothing wrong. He must see that nature, society, government, and industry are perfect in their present stage, and advancing toward completion; and that all men and women everywhere are good and perfect. He must know that allis right with the world, and unite with God for the completion of the perfect work.
    * He must cease to act unthinkingly, and begin to think; and he must be sincere in his thought.
    * The man who reaches the right viewpoint and makes full consecration, and who fully idealizes himself as great, and who makes every act, however trivial, an expression of the ideal, has already attained to greatness. Everything he does will be done in a great way.
    * He will be given ability to deal with any combination of circumstances which may arise, and his growth and progress will be continuous and rapid. Great works will seek him out, and all men will delight to do him honor.

** Notes: 
    * three main types of chips may be used: standard chips, programmable logic devices, and custom chips.
    * A designer of digital systems is faced with two basic issues. For an existing logic network, it must be possible to determine the function performed by the network. This task is referred to as the =analysis process=. The reverse task of designing a new network that implements a desired functional behavior is referred to as the =synthesis process=. The analysis process is rather straightforward and much simpler than the synthesis process
    * A circuit that generates an output that exactly reflects the state of one of a number of data inputs, based on the value of one or more selection control inputs, is called a multiplexer.

** Notes: 
    * you cannot get an intelligent organism, such as a human being, out of an unintelligent universe. You do not find an intelligent organism living in an unintelligent environment.
    * Generally speaking, we have two kinds of consciousness. One I will call the =“spotlight,”= and the other the =“floodlight.”= The spotlight is what we call conscious attention, and we are trained from childhood that it is the most valuable form of perception.
    * People, who by various methods become fully aware of their floodlight consciousness, have what is called “a mystical experience,” or what the Buddhists call bodhi, an awakening.
    * He is absolutely out of his mind because he does not realize that the external world is his body, and when he realizes that he will get his mind back.
    * The real deep down you is the whole universe, and it is doing your living organism and all of its behavior, and expressing it as a singer sings a song.
    * every individual becomes aware that his real self is not just his conscious ego.
    * In the history of philosophy there are three dominant theories of nature. The first theory is the Western theory, which is that nature is a machine, or an artifact. 
      The second theory of nature is an East Indian theory. Nature is seen not as an artifact but as drama.
    * Their greater principle of nature is called the Tao. Tao means the course of nature.
    * Correspondingly, most Westerners, whether they be Christians or non-Christians, do not trust nature. Of all things nature is the thing least to be trusted. You must manage it. You must watch out for it and it will always go wrong if you do not watch out, just as the goblins will get you if you do not watch out. So, we are always feeling that we absolutely cannot trust it because we are instilled with the idea of original sin. You cannot trust nature because it comes out with weeds and insects, and above all, you cannot trust human nature.
    * wu-wei It means not interfering with the course of events and not acting against the grain.
    * Nature as a self-ordering principle, but it does not really know how it does it
    * Any sensible person would imagine that the main functioning of a university is to teach students and to do research. Therefore the faculty should be the most important thing in the university, but on the contrary, the administration is the most important. These are the people who keep the records, and who make the game rules up. So the faculty are always being obstructed by the administration, forced into irrelevant meetings, and asked to do everything but scholarship.
    * That which is the knower—the ground of all knowledge—is never itself an object of knowledge, just as fire does not burn itself.
    * The mystery of life is not a problem to be solved, but a reality to be experienced.
    * matter comes from a Sanskrit root, matra, which means “to measure,” to lay out the foundation of a building.
    * the whole doing of the universe may be understood as a “process.” Nobody is doing it.
    * As the Hindus have taught us, in the course of time everything gets worse and eventually falls apart, and comes the Kali-Yuga and Shiva at the end, which is to say, only suckers put hope in the future.
    * =if you were actually aware of what went on, you could never describe it.=
    * when you gain understanding, you do not put your hope in time because time will not solve a thing
    * Yoga is defined in Sanskrit in the Yoga sutra as yoga chitra briti derota. = “turnings in consciousness.”
    * until there is silence of the mind, it is almost impossible to understand eternal life, that is to say, eternal now.
    * Sir Edwin Arnold, “Forgoing self, the universe grows I.”
    * By dying to yourself, having become completely incompetent and finding that you do not exist, you are reborn and you become everything
    * Figs do not grow on thistles, grapes do not grow on thorns, and therefore you, as an expression of the universe and as an aperture through which the universe is observing itself, cannot be a mere fluke.
    * the Book of Job is the most profound book in the whole Bible, Old Testament and New Testament.
    * everybody, by virtue of being a human being, is willy-nilly a metaphysician.
    * In fact our physical world is a system of inseparable differences. Everything exists with everything else
    * B. F. Skinner, who did not update their philosophy and interpreted life in terms of Newtonian mechanics, saw the organism as something determined by the total environment.
    * The thing was to get to that end, success, or whatever it is, or maybe Heaven after you are dead, but we missed the point along the whole way. It was a musical thing, and you were supposed to sing or dance while the music was being played. Instead you had to do “that thing” and you did not let it happen.
    * life is not serious. It is a play of all kinds of patterns and we can look upon different creatures as we look at different games.
    * You do not understand the basic assumptions of your own culture if your own culture is the only culture you know.
    * Everybody operates on certain basic assumptions, but very few people know what those assumptions are.
    * a thing is a “think.” It is a unit of thought just like an inch is a unit of measurement. So we “thing” the world, which is to say that in order to measure a curve you have to reduce it to a series of points and apply the calculus.
    * in order to discuss or talk about the universe you have to reduce it to things. But each thing, or “think,” is one grasp of the spotlight. We reduce the infinite wiggliness of the world to grasps, or bits, and we are getting back to the idea of biting one’s own teeth, of grasping one’s own thoughts.
    * The system is not the same because there is a fundamental difference between a mechanism and an organism which can be described operationally. A mechanism is assembled; you add this bit to that bit, that bit to this bit. However, an organism grows from within, you do not see little bits coming from all directions to join each other, finally making up a shape.
    * The axioms of any given system must always be defined in terms of a higher system. However, you are the most complex thing that has yet been encountered in the cosmos, and so you cannot figure you out.
    * Lynn White used to say that the academic world today only values three kinds of intelligence: verbal intelligence, mnemonic intelligence (in other words, remembering), and computational intelligence

** Book: The Psychology of Man's Possible Evolution Paperback 
** Link: https://www.amazon.com/Psychology-Mans-Possible-Evolution/dp/0394719433
** Notes: 
    * psychological systems can be divided into tw^o chief categories:
      1. man as they find him  or such as they suppose or imagine him to he.
      2. systems which study he may become; that is, from the point of view of his possible evolution.
      3. the study of lying.
      4. the study of a new language. And this new language is a universal language
    * man as we know him is not a completed being; that nature de- velops him only up to a certain point and then leaves him, to develop further, by his own efforts
    * Evolution of man in this case will mean the development of certain inner qualities and features which usually remain undeveloped, and cannot develop by themselves.
    * in the way of development, man must become a different being,
    * Why cannot all men develop and become different beings?
        The answer is very simple. Because they do not want it. Because they do not know about it and will
        not understand without a long preparation what it
        means, even if they are told.
    * The evolution of man depends on his understanding of what he may get and what he must give for it.
    * before acquiring any new faculties or powers which man does not know and does not possess now, he must acquire faculties and powers he also does not possess, but which he ascribes to himself; that is, he thinks that he knows them and can use and control them.
    * Man does not know himself.
    * Man has invented many machines, and he knows that a complicated machine needs sometimes years of careful study before one can use it or control it. But he does not apply this knowledge to himself, although he himself is a much more complicated machine than any machine he has invented.
    * =First of all, he does not realize that he actually is a machine.=
    * What does it mean that man is a machine?

      It means that he has no independent movementSy inside or outside of himself. He is a machine which is brought into motion by external influences and external impacts. All his movements, actions, words, ideas, emotions, moods, and thoughts are produced by ex- ternal influences. By himself, he is just an automaton with a certain store of memories of previous experi- ences, and a certain amount of reserve energy.
      
      We must understand that man can do nothing.

    * Man is a machine, but a very peculiar machine. He is a machine which, in right circumstances, and with right treatment, can know that he is a machine, and, having fully realized this, he may find the ways to cease to be a machine.
    * The highest moments of consciousness  create memory. Other moments simply does not remember. 
    * The fact is that consciousness has quite visible and observable degrees, certainly visible and observable in oneself. First, there is duration: how long one was conscious. Second, frequency of appearance: how often one became conscious. Third, the extent and penetration: of what one was conscious, which can vary very much with the growth of man.
    * For general description, man has possibility of four states of consciousness. self-consciousness They are: sleepy waking statCy and objective consciousness.
    * you remember only the moments when  you were conscious.
    * For with right methods and the right efforts man can acquire control of consciousness and can become , conscious of himself
    * One cannot study psychology as one can study as-tronomy; that is, apart from oneself.
    * Functions can exist without consciousness exist without functions. 
    * These are simply wrong expressions, wrong terms, which mean nothing and do not refer to any real facts. There is nothing permanently subconscious in us because there is nothing permanently conscious; and there is no "subconscious mind" for the very simple reason that there is no "conscious mind."
    * The first is sleep. The second is "waking sleep" or "relative consciousness."
    * Self-consciousness is a state in which man becomes objective towards himself
    * This means that frequency and duration of moments of self-consciousness depend on the command one has over oneself. So it means that con- sciousness and will are almost one and the same thing, or in any case aspects of the same thing.
    * In the system we are studying, these two parts are called essence and personality. Essence is what is born in man. Personality is what is acquired.
    * to know ourselves -- when in reality it means to know our- selves as machines, that is, to know the structure of one's machine, its parts, functions of different parts, the conditions governing their work, and so on. The means of this study is called self-observation
    * In observing himself, he must always remember that his self-study is the first step towards his possible evolution.
    * Life as it is could not exist without lying.
    * He discovers that the more he can control a manifestation, the less harmful it can be, and that the less he can control it, that is, the more mechanical it is, the more harmful it can become.
    * The second dangerous feature he finds in himself is imagination. He wishes to obstacle to observationis observe something, butinstead of that, imagination starts in him on the same subject, and he forgets about observation.
    * The difficulties he has in observing these four mani- festations—lying, imagination, the expression of nega- tive emotions, and unnecessary talking— will show his utter man mechanicalness,
    * The first is called /identification./  This means that in the state of identification man is incapable of looking im- partially on the object of his identification. 
    * It is impossible to know oneself without knowing one's defects and wrong features.
    * FIRST, that the human machine does not work up to its standard and actually woiks much beJow its normal standard; that is, not with its full powers, not with all its parts; and SECOND, that in spite of many obstacles it is capable oi developing and creating for itself quite different standards of receptivity and action.
    * The first of these conditions is that man must understand his position, his difficulties, and his possibili- ties, and must have either a very strong desire to get out of his present state or have a very great interest for the new, for the unknown state which must come with the change. Speaking shortly, he must be either very strongly repelled by his present state or very strongly attracted by the future state that may be at- tained. Further, one must have a certain preparation. A man must be able to understand what he is told. Also, he must be in right conditions externally; he must have sufficient free time for study and must live in circumstances which make study possible.
    * The first kind consists of interests and attractions created by life itself; interests of one's health, safety, wealth, pleasures, amusements, security, vanity, pride, fame, etc. The second kind consists of interests of a different order aroused by ideas which are not created in life but come originally from schools.
    * Man must sacrifice his suffering.
    * What I mean is that by giving to our thoughts the direction which they would have in a moment of consciousness, we can, in this way, induce consciousness.
    * First, that you do not remember yourself; that is, that you are
      not aware of yourself at the time when you try to observe
      yourself. Second, that observation is made difficult by the
      inces- sant stream of thoughts, images, echoes of conversa-
      tion, fragments of emotions, flowing through your mind and very
      often distracting your attention from observation. And third,
      that the moment you start self-observation something in you
      starts imagination, and self-observation, if you really try it,
      is a constant struggle with imagination.
    * one cannot remember oneself one already knows what one must do. =One must try to remember oneself.=
    * we can remember ourselves for a short time at will, because we have a certain command over our thoughts. And if we start over states of consciousness. But remembering ourselves, by the special construction of our thoughts— that is, by the realization that we do not remember ourselves, that nobody remembers himself, and by realizing all that this means— this will bring us to consciousness.
    * These two sides of man, or two lines of possible development, are =knowledge and being,=
    * A Russian philosopher, Vladimir Solovieff, used the term ''being'' in his writings. He spoke about the being of a stone, the being of a plant, the being of an animal, the being of a man, and the divine being.
    * you cannot understand and disagree.
    * Understanding may be compared to an arithmetical mean between knowledge and being. It shows the necessity for a simultaneous growth of knowledge and being.
    * you can understand other people only as much as you un- derstand yourself and only on the level of your
    * you can judge other people's knowledge, but you cannot judge their being.
    * the attention in this part of the center must be controlled and kept there by will and effort.
    * all your work upon yourself is connected with self-remembering and that it cannot proceed successfully without this. And self- remembering is partial awakeningy or the beginning of awakening. Naturally— and this must be very clear- =no work can be done in sleep.=
    * THiNK very seriously before you decide to work on yourself with the idea of changing yourself, that is, to work with the definite aim to become conscious and to develop the connection with higher centers. work admits of no compromise and it This requires a great amount of self-discipline and readiness to obey all rules and particularly direct instructions.
    * If you decide to work and accept all that comes in the work, you must learn to think quickly. If you are offered a task you accept it. If must answer at once that you you hesitate or take time to answer, the offer of the task will be withdrawn and it will not be repeated.

** Notes: 
Known Your Strength: 
    * The only way to discover your strengths is through feedback analysis. Whenever you make a key decision or take a key action, write down what you expect will happen. Nine or 12 months later, compare the actual results with your expectations.
    * Practiced consistently, this simple method will show you within a fairly short period of time, maybe two or three years, where your strengths lie—and this is the most important thing to know. The method will show you what you are doing or failing to do that deprives you of the full benefits of your strengths.
    * First and foremost, concentrate on your strengths. Put yourself where your strengths can produce results.
    * Second, work on improving your strengths. Analysis will rapidly show where you need to improve skills or acquire new ones. It will also show the gaps in your knowledge—and those can usually be filled. Mathematicians are born, but everyone can learn trigonometry.
    * Third, discover where your intellectual ar- rogance is causing disabling ignorance and overcome it.
    * Go to work on acquiring the skills and knowledge you need to fully realize your strengths.
    * It is equally essential to remedy your bad habits—the things you do or fail to do that in- hibit your effectiveness and performance.
    * Energy, resources, and time should go instead to making a competent person into a star performer.

HOW DO I PERFORM?
    * Like one’s strengths, how one performs is unique. It is a matter of personality.

How do I learn?
    * Some people learn by doing. Others learn by hearing themselves talk.
    * understanding how you learn is the easiest to acquire.
    * acting on this knowledge is the key to performance; or rather, voz acting on this knowledge con- demns one to nonperformance.
    * The conclusion bears repeating: =Do not try to change yourself—you are unlikely to succeed. But work hard to improve the way you perform. And try not to take on work you cannot perform or will only perform poorly.=

WHAT ARE MY VALUES?
    * mirrors test: What kind of person do I want to see in the mirror in the morning?
    * A person’s strengths and the way that per- son performs rarely conflict; the two are complementary.
    * But most people, especially highly gifted people, do not really know where they belong until they are well past their mid-twenties.
    * By that time, however, they should know the answers to the three questions: =What are my strengths? How do I perform? and, What are my values?=
    * =Successful careers are not planned. They develop when people are prepared for opportunities because they know their strengths, their method of work, and their values.=
    * What does the situation require? Given my strengths, my way of per- forming, and my values, how can I make the greatest contribution to what needs to be done? And finally, What results have to be achieved to make a difference?
    * Managing your- self requires taking responsibility for relationships. 1. accept the fact that other people are as much individuals as you yourself are. 2.
    * it is incumbent on the people who work with them to observe them, to find out how they work, and to adapt themselves to what makes their bosses most effective. This, in fact, is the secret of “managing” the boss.
    * The first secret of effectiveness is to understand the people you work with and depend on so that you can make use of their strengths, their ways of working, and their values.
    * taking responsibility for communication.
    * Today, however, most work is knowledge work, and knowledge workers are not “finished” after 40 years on the job, they are merely bored.
    * There are three ways to develop a second career. The first is actually to start one. But above all, they need challenge. The second way to prepare for the second half of your life is to develop a parallel career. Finally, there are the social entrepreneurs.
    * There is one prerequisite for managing the second half of your life: =You must begin long before you enter it.=
    * and equally for the individual’s family, to have an area in which he or she can contribute, make a difference, and be somebody. That means finding a second area—whether in a second career, a parallel career, or a social venture— that offers an opportunity for being a leader, for being respected, for being a success.

** Book: THE MATTER WITH THINGS

** Notes: 

Preface
   * neuropsychology – how our brains shape reality; epistemology – how we can come to know anything at all; metaphysics – the nature of what we find in the cosmos.
   * the brain’s left hemisphere is designed to help us ap-prehend – and thus manipulate – the world; the right hemisphere to com-prehend it – see it all for what it is.
   * Since what you find is a product of how you attend, this is a more or less pointless exercise in making sure that both parties sink to the bottom in the shortest possible time.
   * Reductionsim = separte part of nature and build it up
   * to see the Universe as it really is, we must abandon our tendency to conceptualize observations as things
   * reality as merely a special case of our representation
   * Potential is not simply all the things that never happened, The actual is the limit case of the potential,
   * Reality Out There (ROT), the nature of which is independent of any consciousness of it: naïve realism.
   * Made Up Miraculously By Ourselves (MUMBO): naïve idealism.
   * The relationship comes before the relata – the ‘things’ that are supposed to be related. What we mean by the word ‘and’ is not just additive, but /creative./
   * It is not a re-presentation, but a real presence: there is not a wall between us and the world. Our experience is of whatever-it-is and not another thing, even if we can’t get away from the fact that it is we who experience it
   * The experience of understanding involves a shift from what seems initially chaotic or formless, to a coherent stable form or picture, a /Gestalt/ – or from an existing Gestalt to a new and better one, that seems richer than the one it replaces.
   * The idea of a Gestalt is central to this book: by it I mean the form of a whole that cannot be reduced to parts without the loss of something essential to its nature. Indeed, what I hope to offer in this book is just such a Gestalt – one that is based on an understanding of the import of the structure of our brains.
   * universe is always creative, though it has order, and is not random or chaotic; the world is always a matter of responsiveness, though it is equally not a free-for-all. It is a process of creative collaboration, of co-creation.
   * Yet we, and you, partake of its making, even if we are only listeners.
   * =what follows the reader may come to see grounds for a view that the world is a seamless, always self-creating, self-individuating, and simultaneously self-uniting, flow that is only truly knowable as it comes to be known.= creativity is always discovery of the self as well as of the other. 
   * if we are truly responsive to it. We nurture it into being; or not. In this it has something of the structure of love.
   * To the left hemisphere, you find the truth about something by building it up from bits. But, as the right hemisphere is aware, to understand it you need to experience it as a whole, since the whole reveals as much about the nature of the parts as the parts do about the nature of the whole.
   * This clarification was necessary, because I will be explaining that the world we experience – which is the only one we can know – is affected by the kind of attention we pay to it.
   * Attention changes the world. How you attend to it changes what it is you find there.
   * our consciousness is disposed towards whatever else exists.
   * The choice we make of how we dispose our consciousness is the ultimate creative act: it renders the world what it is. It is, therefore, a moral act: it has consequences. ‘Love’, said the French philosopher Louis Lavelle, ‘is a pure attention to the existence of the other’.
   * Attention is not just another ‘cognitive function’: it is, as I say, the disposition adopted by one’s consciousness towards the world.
   * That something is not manifest is not to say it doesn’t exist.
   * [by even] each hemisphere has its own consciousness, but introspectiion we only show one reality. since consciousness fusion is underlying.
   * ‘Abstract schemes of morphology’: all advances in science are made by observing patterns, by using metaphors and formal analogies. And, if we wanted examples, we have them at the highest level:
   * Not ignorance, but ignorance of ignorance, is the death of knowledge.
   * Relying on the right hemisphere alone could be thought of as losing your glasses, but at least retaining your eyesight; relying on the left hemisphere alone is a little like having your glasses on, but having your eyes tight shut.
   * many things are better understood by observing, not the ‘parts’, but the whole of which they are themselves part: seeing the Gestalt.
   * The truly foundational aspects of our experience – starting with consciousness itself – belong to the realm of things which permit no ultimate resolution.

     
Volumn 1
   * One concerns the top-to-bottom axis – the development of the neocortex; the second concerns the side-to-side axis – the development of the corpus callosum; and the third concerns the front-to- back axis – the development of the frontal lobes.
   * The corpus callosum itself comes to embody the predicament of the entire cortex, and ultimately of the human world: how to hold things together, and yet keep them apart. Another theme of this book is the importance of union and division together.
   * And this is true of all human experience, including those aspects that are, of all, the ‘closest’: our relationships with others we may love. They all require and benefit from necessary distance.
   * Things and their opposites depend on one another for their being, bring about something new through their opposition, and ultimately co-create the world. They are dipoles.
   * The more focal attention is narrowed, the more it takes its object out of the realm of time, space, the body and emotion. A virtual world is merely the conclusion of that process – and that is where the evolution of the left hemisphere leads: to a virtual world.
   * the right hemisphere is more in touch with reality, and the left hemisphere more concerned with the internal consistency of whatever virtual model of the world it happens to be working with at the time.
   * the right hemisphere has by far the greater control of attention in general, as well as for switching attention
   * When attentional demands increase, in whatever way, the right hemisphere tends to take over for the whole field.

** Book: tao te ching translated by stephen mitchell
** Notes: 
   * Less and less do you need to force things, until finally you arrive at non-action. When nothing is done, nothing is left undone.
   * Hence Lao-tzu’s emphasis on softness.
   * The Master has mastered Nature; not in the sense of conquering it, but of becoming it
   * The unnamable is the eternally real. Naming is the origin of all particular things.
   * Free from desire, you realize the mystery. Caught in desire, you see only the manifestations.
   * Therefore the Master acts without doing anything and teaches without saying anything. Things arise and she lets them come; things disappear and she lets them go. She has but doesn’t possess, acts but doesn’t expect. When her work is done, she forgets it.That is why it lasts forever.
   * The Tao is like a bellows: it is empty yet infinitely capable. The more you use it, the more it produces; the more you talk of it, the less you understand.
   * Why is it infinite? It has no desires for itself; thus it is present for all beings.
   * When you are content to be simply yourself and don’t compare or compete, everybody will respect you.
   * Giving birth and nourishing, having without possessing, acting with no expectations, leading and not trying to control: this is the supreme virtue.
   * when it comes to detecting unexpected change, the left hemisphere is relatively blind compared with the right hemisphere.
   * the left hemisphere’s attention is narrow at the best of times, even as regards its favoured right side of the attentional field.
   * the right hemisphere’s attention is maximally flexible, whereas the attention paid by the left hemisphere tends to be ‘sticky’.
   * the right hemisphere integrates, while the left hemisphere fragments.
   * The more precise anything is, the less content it has: ‘the more certain our knowledge the less we know.’
   * The right hemisphere tends to present the world in three dimensions, with volume and depth as we experience it.
   * The left hemisphere, in other words, draws the ‘theory’, or idea, of a cube, what we know (that the cube has six sides), not the actual cube we perceive by paying attention to it
   * All in all, it is the right hemisphere that underwrites our sense of the depth of space, time and –motion
   * The Master observes the world but trusts his inner vision. He allows things to come and go. His heart is open as the sky.
   * Hope and fear are both phantoms that arise from thinking of the self. When we don’t see the self as self, what do we have to fear?
   * See the world as your self. Have faith in the way things are. Love the world as your self; then you can care for all things.
   * You can’t know it, but you can be it, at ease in your own life. Just realize where you come from: this is the essence of wisdom.
   * The Master doesn’t seek fulfillment. Not seeking, not expecting, she is present, and can welcome all things.
   * Empty your mind of all thoughts. Let your heart be at peace. Watch the turmoil of beings, but contemplate their return. 
   * When you realize where you come from, you naturally become tolerant, disinterested, amused, kindhearted as a grandmother, dignified as a king. Immersed in the wonder of the Tao, you can deal with whatever life brings you, and when death comes, you are ready.
   * If you don’t trust the people, you make them untrustworthy. The Master doesn’t talk, he acts. When his work is done, the people say, “Amazing: we did it, all by ourselves!”
   * When the body’s intelligence declines, cleverness and knowledge step forth.
   * If these three aren’t enough, just stay at the center of the circle and let all things take their course.
   * Other people have what they need; I alone possess nothing. I alone drift about, like someone without a home. I am like an idiot, my mind is so empty. I drift like a wave on the ocean, I blow as aimless as the wind.
   * This disowning has its roots in a disconnect between the perceived outcome and the conscious will. The left hemisphere’s is the wilful consciousness, the one that makes things happen. Its purpose is clear: action towards a target that is centre-stage, taking possession of what is in full vision.
   * left-hemisphere: Confabulation means the invention of a story to fill in a gap. It is not the same as lying. In lying we are conscious of the deceit; in confabulation the subject believes the story.
   * you take in the whole first, and then your gaze is attracted by particular parts.
   * ‘hierarchy of attention’, which means that we see things whole with the right hemisphere first, before homing in on details with the sharply, but narrowly, focussed gaze of the left hemisphere.
   * The right hemisphere gets the form, the shape, the whole: the left hemisphere gets the bits and pieces.
   * Attention is responsible not just for the how (though it is), not just for the what (though it is), but, as far as the left hemisphere is concerned, for the whether-at-all of existence.
   * the left hemisphere can provide some sorts of knowledge about the world, as it would be scrutinised from a certain theoretical point of view effectively outside the realms of space and time (as on a map); whereas the right hemisphere provides us with the knowledge of the world in space and time (as experienced).
   * The left hemisphere’s limited appreciation of depth in space and time is in keeping with its tendency towards stasis. It seems to lack appreciation, not just of motion, but of emotion; it relatively lacks appropriate emotional depth, or concern, tending to be irritable or facetious, especially when challenged. It tends to disown problems, and pass the responsibility to others; is overconfident about what it cannot in the nature of things know much about; fabricates (often improbable) stories to cover its ignorance; sees parts at the expense of wholes; tends to see ‘from the outside’, rather than experience ‘from the inside’; and has an affinity for the inanimate, and for tools and machines in particular.
